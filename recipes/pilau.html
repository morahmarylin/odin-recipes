    <h3><u>Here is a recipe for a classic East African beef pilau, a fragrant and flavorful rice dish. </u></p>
    <ul>
    <h3><u>Ingredients</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tbsp cooking oil or ghee</li>
        <li>2 medium onions, sliced or chopped</li>
        <li>1 lb (500g) beef, cut into cubes</li>
        <li>1 tbsp garlic-ginger mince (or paste)</li>
        <li>1 heaped tbsp whole pilau mix (cumin, cardamom pods, black peppercorns, cinnamon stick, cloves)</li>
        <li>2 beef stock cubes (or to taste)</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>3 medium potatoes, peeled and halved/quartered (optional)</li>
        <li>3 cups basmati rice, rinsed and drained</li>
        <li>3 & 1/2 cups beef broth (from boiling the beef) or water </li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <h3><u>Steps</u></h3>
        <li>Prepare the Beef: Boil the cubed beef in about 1 liter of water with some salt until tender. Once cooked, reserve approximately 3.5 cups of the beef broth and set the beef aside.</li>
        <li>Sauté Aromatics: In a large pot, heat the oil or ghee over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and sauté until they turn a deep golden brown (this caramelization is key for the pilau color and flavor).</li>
        <li>Add Spices and Garlic: Add the garlic-ginger mince and the whole pilau spices mix. Stir constantly and cook for about a minute until fragrant and the aroma fills the kitchen.</li>
        <li>Incorporate Beef and Potatoes: Add the pre-boiled beef cubes and optional potatoes to the pot. Mix well and cook for a few minutes to allow the meat to absorb the flavors.</li>
        <li>Add Liquid and Rice: Crumble in the stock cubes and mix. Pour in the measured beef broth and bring the mixture to a simmer. Add the rinsed basmati rice, stirring gently to combine.</li>
        <li>Cook the Pilau: Bring everything back to a boil, then reduce the heat to the lowest setting. Cover the pot tightly with a lid (using aluminum foil before the lid can help trap the steam effectively).</li>
        <li>Steam and Serve: Steam for about 15-20 minutes, or until all the liquid has been absorbed and the rice is cooked through. Turn off the heat and let it sit for another 10 minutes before fluffing with a fork. </li>
     </ol>

     <h1> Recipe Tip </h1>
     <p>Serve your pilau hot, typically with a side of kachumbari (fresh tomato and onion salad).</p>
