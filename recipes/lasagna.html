    <p>The History of Lasagna is an interesting one, with the exact origins of the meal having always been disputed, between Italy to Greece and even England. This is due to various ancient dishes which have been connected to what we know now as classic lasagna.</p>

    <p>The closest example of what we are now familiar with, and has become one of the most famous meals in the world, originates from Naples during the middle ages. The first recorded recipe of this version has been found as far back as the 14th century. This recipe was later evolved into the traditional lasagna of Naples ‘lasagne di carnevale’ which is layered with local sausage, small fried meatballs, hard-boiled eggs, ricotta or mozzarella cheese and Neapolitan Ragù. </p>

    <p>However, what could be considered as the most well-known variation in the world traces back to the Italian region of Emilia-Romagna and is referred to as ‘Lasagne al Forno’. This name refers to the familiar layered dish made with a thick ragù and bechamel sauce, ricotta or mozzarella cheese, typically flavored with wine, onion, and oregano. In all cases, the lasagna is oven-baked ‘al forno’.</p>

    <p>An interesting fact that most people out of Italy are not aware of is that the traditional form of the Emilia-Romagna baked lasagna is made with a green sheets of pasta that incorporates spinach in the recipe.</p>

    <p>The region of Emilia-Romagna has a rich history which includes the originations of some of the most famous Italian foods including tortellini, tagliatelle,  Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, Prosciutto Parma ham, and mortadella. It is this very region where you will find the towns of Bologna, Parma and Modena, as well as Correggio where Veroni was founded in 1925.</p>

        <li>1 pound small-curd cottage cheese</li>

        <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>

        <li>1 (16 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <h3><u>Steps</u></h3>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside. While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined.</li>
        <li>Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish just to to coat it. Place two layers of noodles over the sauce to cover.</li>
        <li>Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers once more using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.</li>
     </ol>

     <h1> Recipe Tip </h1>
     <p>For a more traditional filling, substitute ricotta cheese for the cottage cheese. You can also add layers of veggies, such as spinach and mushrooms, when layering your lasagna.</p>
